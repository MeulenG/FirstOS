#     Formats the partition table in MBR format and installs a

#     Formats the partition table in GPT format and installs a

    # label
    # The label for this partition. For some filesystems this label
    # will also be the name the partition will appear under. For FAT

    # type
    #     values: {FAT, MFS}
    #
    # FAT
    # FAT16 for any size less than 512mb, size must be above 64mb. FAT supports installation
    # of a stage1 and stage2 bootloader.
    #
    # MFS
    # MFS is natively supported by this tool, but is a custom, not very good filesystem
    # for MollenOS/Vali. Don't use this as it is subject to being changed. MFS supports
    # installation of stage1 and stage2 bootloaders.

    # guid
    # The guid for the partition, this is only used if the disk schema is GPT or
    # if the filesystem has any guid identifier in it's superblock. The GUID present
    # below is the EFI System GUID.

    #####################
    # size
    # The size of this partition. This cannot be more than all the partitions combined
    # or be larger than the disk size. For the last partition its not required to specify
    # the partition size, as this will resize the partition to the last remaining disk capacity.

    # attributes
    #     values: {boot, readonly, shadow, noautomount}
    #
    # Partition attributes, primarily used by the GPT table or if the filesystem
    # supports them. When using GPT and want to mark a partition as BIOS bootable
    # the 'boot' attribute must be specified for this partition.
