## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before any attempt is made to build, please do run the following script which updates and clones submodules:
```sh
./setup.sh
```
```dev.sh``` script will make sure you have all the needed packages required to build the OS:
```sh
./dev.sh
```
Additionally, you can install .NET by running:
```sh
./dotnet-install.sh
```
